Files were saved as .rds files for ease of use. Please see [get_data.R](./get_data.R) for how to recreate these datasets yourself.

Note: The PHUSE test data factory data were derived from the original CDISC pilot data. These data have their own terms of use, which can be found [here](https://github.com/cdisc-org/sdtm-adam-pilot-project#terms-of-use)
